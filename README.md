# Kelvi "Dalmazox" Dalmazo 👽

I’m Kelvi Rafael Dalmazo, a Senior Developer at Neon Pagamentos and a graduate in Computer Science. Since 1999, I’ve been on this journey of learning and evolution, fascinated by how technology can solve problems and turn ideas into reality. I work with .NET and Golang, and I have solid experience in microservices, messaging, workflows, and cloud computing ☁️. My focus is always on delivering scalable and robust solutions, creating domain-driven and event-driven applications, and developing libraries that help accelerate and simplify the development of new applications 🚀.

I love contributing to the tech community 💻. I participate in open source projects, reviewing, improving, and learning from other developers. I have a strong passion for teaching: I’ve trained new devs, assisted in mentorships, and always strive to bring healthy discussions about how we can improve code quality and teamwork. For me, collective growth is what makes the difference in any project 🤝.

My goal has always been to create technological solutions that not only solve problems but also make a difference in the lives of those who use them 🌟. I enjoy exploring new topics, experimenting with ideas, and stepping out of my comfort zone, whether it’s architecting systems in cloud computing or questioning traditional approaches. What motivates me is seeing the real impact of what we build together in a collaborative, practical, and innovative way 💡.
